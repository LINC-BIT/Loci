**FedKNOW** comes from "FedKNOW: Federated Continual Learning with Signature Task Knowledge Integration at Edge". It is a client side solution that continuously extracts and integrates the knowledge of signature tasks which are highly influenced by the current task. Each client of FedKNOW is composed of a knowledge extractor, a gradient restorer and, most importantly, a gradient integrator. Upon training for a new task, the gradient integrator ensures the prevention of catastrophic forgetting and mitigation of negative knowledge transfer by effectively combining signature tasks identified from the past local tasks and other clientsâ€™ current tasks through the global model.



You can use the following command to run FedKNOW:



~~~sh
```shell
cd baselines
cd FedKNOW  # method name
python main_FedKNOW.py --task_number=10 --class_number=100 --dataset=cifar100 ## deploy EWC
